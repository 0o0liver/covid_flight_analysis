# Disease data

1. Please run this code using: ```python construct.py '03,04'``` and the string inside the quotation marks should be the months you want to know separated by commas.

2. Inside the city_list file, I listed several big cities around the US. The format of each line should be 'city,state', eg: 'Los Angeles, California'. If you want to consider more cities, please add the data in the same format. Here is a mapping between the county and city:

```
District of Columbia: Washington D.C.
Cook: Chicago
Suffolk: Boston
King: Seattle
Maricopa: Phoenix
Bexar: San Antonio
Salt Lake: Salt Lake City
Shelby: Memphis
Davidson: Nashville
Wayne: Detroit
Mecklenburg: Charlotte
Harris: Houston
Santa Clara: San Jose
Marion: Indianapolis
```

3. The output of this code is a single csv file contains four-column data, which are: city, date, cases and deaths. They are ordered by (city, date).
